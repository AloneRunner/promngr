    guideDeepPassTitle: "📐 Tactical Analysis Report: Width & Passing",
    guideDeepPassContent: `1. Passing Style
This setting doesn't just change "how they pass", it alters the entire decision mechanism. The difference between Short and Direct is massive.

A. Short Passing
"Keep the ball, no rush."

Engine Effect:
🦶 Love for Short Distance: If a teammate is closer than 15m, that pass gets +30 Score. HUGE bonus for AI.
🚫 Penalty for Long Pass: As distance exceeds 15m, score drops rapidly. They resist long balls.
🛡️ Zero Risk: Desire to dribble drops by -10. They avoid risky moves.
🧠 Pass Priority: +20 Score bonus to 'Pass' decision over Shot/Dribble.
When to Use:
• Technical midfield, good passers.
• Playing "Possession" style.
• Protecting a lead.

B. Direct Passing
"Vertical, straight to goal!" Premier League style.

Engine Effect:
🚀 Aerial Bonus: +20 Score for Aerial passes and Crosses. They don't mind lifting the ball.
🔫 Shoot & Dribble: Interesting detail; Shoot score +15, Dribble score +10! They want to go to goal individually too.
📉 Safety Penalty: Side passes get -10 score. No "boring play".
When to Use:
• Fast forwards (to hit behind defense).
• Physical team.
• Bad pitch or heavy pressing opponent.
• Perfect match for "Counter Attack".

C. Balanced (Mixed)
Standard setting. Players choose the best option regardless of distance.

2. Width
Determines how the team uses the pitch geometry.

A. Narrow
"Drill through the center."

Code Secret:
🧱 Central Play: If a player is NOT near the touchline, Pass (+15) and Dribble (+10) bonus.
Effect: Players become creative when crowded in the middle. They try 1-2s instead of going wide.
Best Formations: 4-1-2-1-2 (Diamond), 4-3-1-2, 5-3-2.

B. Wide
"Hit the line, cross it in."

Code Secret:
🏍️ Wing Raids: If a player is on the wing, Dribble desire increases by +20! They become dribbling monsters.
🎯 Cross Bonus: If on the wing and in the final third, Cross score +15. Focus is to get down the line and center it.
Best Formations: 4-3-3, 3-4-3, 4-4-2.`,

    guideDeepTempoTitle: "⚡ Tactical Analysis Report: Tempo & Defense",
    guideDeepTempoContent: `1. Tempo (Game Speed)
A. Slow - "Chess"
• Decision Time: Increases x1.4. (They think more)
• Turnovers: Decreased.
• Opponent: Gets time to organize defense.
• Usage: Protecting lead, technical team.

B. Fast - "Chaos"
• Decision Time: Decreases x0.7! (Panic passes)
• Error Rate: High.
• Effect: Overwhelms the opponent.
• Usage: Chasing a goal, tired opponent.

2. Defensive Line
A. Deep - "Bunker"
• Position: 20-30m from goal.
• Pro: No space behind (Mbappe proof).
• Con: You surrender midfield control.

B. High - "Offside Trap"
• Position: Near midfield.
• Pro: You trap the opponent in their half.
• Con: Every long ball is a 90% goal chance.`,
