    guideDeepPassTitle: "1. Passing Style",
    guideDeepPassContent: `1. Passing Style
⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE: The "Short Passing" option has been REMOVED from the game engine because it prevented teams from shooting and locked up play.

A. Direct Passing
"Vertical, go to goal!" philosophy. Premier League style.
• 🚀 Aerial Bonus: +20 Points for aerial passes and crosses.
• 🔫 Shoot & Dribble: Shoot (+15) and Dribble (+10) desire increases! They want to be heroes.
• 📉 Safe Pass Penalty: Side passing desire reduced by -10 Points.
When?: Fast forwards, Physical team, Bad pitch, Counter-attacks.

B. Balanced (Mixed)
Standard setting. Players choose the best option (highest score) regardless of distance.

2. Width
This setting determines how the team parcels out the pitch.

A. Narrow
"Must go through the middle" tactic.
• 🧱 Center Play: If player is NOT near touchline, Pass (+15) and Dribble (+10) bonus.
• Effect: Players prefer one-twos in the center rather than going wide.
• Suitable: 4-1-2-1-2 (Diamond), 4-3-1-2, 5-3-2.

B. Wide
"Hit the line, cross it" tactic.
• 🏍️ Wing Attacks: Dribble desire increases by +20 Points if on the wing!
• 🎯 Cross Bonus: Pass (Cross) points +15 in attack zone.
• Suitable: 4-3-3, 3-4-3, 4-4-2.`,

    guideDeepTempoTitle: "⚡ Detailed Analysis: Tempo & Defense",
    guideDeepTempoContent: `1. Tempo (Game Speed)
A. Slow - "Chess"
• Decision Time: x1.4 slower (They think more).
• Turnover Risk: Reduced.
• Use: Protecting score, technical team.

B. Fast - "Chaos"
• Decision Time: x0.7 faster (Panic passes).
• Error Risk: High.
• Effect: Overwhelms the opponent.

2. Defensive Line
A. Deep - "Bunker"
• Position: 20-30m from goal.
• Advantage: No space behind (Anti-Mbappe).
• Disadvantage: Midfield control given to opponent.

B. High - "Offside Trap"
• Position: Near midfield.
• Advantage: Trap opponent in their half.
• Disadvantage: Through balls are 90% goal chances.`,

    guideDeepComboTitle: "🛠️ Critical Combination Recommendations",
    guideDeepComboContent: `⚠️ "Chaos Football (Klopp Style)":
Style: High Press + Pass: Direct + Width: Wide
Result: Match ends 4-3. Fans go crazy.

⚠️ "Italian Wall (Catenaccio)":
Style: Counter + Pass: Direct + Width: Narrow
Result: Win 1-0 and go home.

EXPERT: Development Math
Actual formulas inside the game engine:
1. Age Factor:
• < 21 Years: 5% Growth Chance (Very Fast)
• 21-24 Years: 3% Growth Chance (Normal)
• 24-28 Years: 1% Growth Chance (Slow)
• 28+ Years: Growth STOPS. Can only maintain form by playing.
• 32+ Years: 5% chance to DECLINE every week (Retirement nearing).

2. Facility Effect:
• Training Facility: +0.5% chance per Level.
• Head Coach: +0.8% bonus per Level.
• EXAMPLE: An 18-year-old with Lvl 10 Facility & Lvl 5 Coach has ~15% growth chance weekly!

3. Fatigue (Condition):
• Condition < 60%: Training efficiency HALVED.
• Condition < 30%: Player skips training to rest.
• TIP: Rest players with "Light" training after matches to speed up growth!`,

    guideFacilitiesTitle: "🏢 Facilities & Staff",
    guideStadiumEffect: `Stadium
• Each level = +6,000 capacity. More fans = more ticket revenue.

🏋️ Training Center
• Training Center: Increases player development speed.

EXPERT: Return on Investment (ROI)
How to grow without going bankrupt?

1. Maintenance Costs (Hidden Expense):
• Formula: (Level ^ 1.3) x 2,000 €
• Level 1 Stadium: 2,000 € / week
• Level 15 Stadium: ~70,000 € / week (Huge spike!)
• TIP: Do not upgrade facilities if your income hasn't increased. You will go bankrupt.

2. Stadium Math:
• Each seat yields avg. 15 €.
• +2000 Capacity (1 Upgrade) = +30,000 € Extra Revenue/week.
• Takes ~100 weeks (2 seasons) to cover the 3M € cost.
• RESULT: Stadium is a long-term investment. It loses money in the short term.

3. Academy vs Scout:
• Academy Lvl 10: 5% chance for a mediocre youth (50-60 OVR) weekly.
• Scout Lvl 10: 10% chance for a TALENTED youth (65-80 Pot/OVR) weekly.
• ADVICE: Invest in Scout first. You can sell found talents for 5-10M €!`,

    guideMoralePerform: `Morale directly affects player performance (OVR).

EXPERT: Morale Math
Morale defines the player's IQ on the pitch.

1. How Morale Drops?
• Star in Reserves: If OVR > 75 and not playing, -3 Morale/week (Star Ego).
• Regular Sub: If OVR 65-75, -1 Morale/week.
• Youngsters (<65 OVR): They don't mind not playing (Stable).

2. In-Match Impact (Crucial!):
• 80-100 Morale: Plays with 110% performance. Won't miss passes.
• 40-60 Morale: Normal performance.
• 0-20 Morale: Misses open goals. GK lets ball slip through hands.
• CRITICAL: Never play an unhappy star in a derby. Sell them.`,

EXPERT: Negotiation Secrets
How to convince the AI?

1. "Willingness" Score:
Need > 50 points for player to say "Yes":
• League Diff: England vs Turkey difference is capped (Max -7 Pts).
• Team Rep: +1 Pt for every 75 reputation difference.
• Champions League: Indirectly boosts willingness via reputation.

2. Money Talks (Wage Strategy):
Use wage to turn "No" into "Yes":
• 1.5x Wage Offer: +25 Willingness Pts.
• 2.0x Wage Offer: +50 Pts (MAX EFFECT).
• WARNING: Offering 3.0x wage gives NO extra points! 2.0x is the cap.

3. Selling Tactics:
• AI offers 100-150% value for listed players.
• They MUST pay 120-170% for unlisted players.
• TIP: Don't list your stars if you don't want to sell; make AI pay a fortune!`,

EXPERT: Legal Cheats
How to cover budget deficits:

1. "Buy-Low Sell-High" (Farming):
• Sign "Free Agent" players aged 16-19 at start of season.
• Wages are only 25-50K €.
• Train them for 10 weeks, then list them.
• Even at 100K € value, it's profit. Getting free players and selling for 100K is clean money.

2. Sponsor Gambling:
• If aiming for title: Pick "Risky" (5M € Bonus).
• If mid-table: Pick "Guaranteed" for safe weekly cash flow.
